# Programming-for-data-science-project
This is a repository containing source code for the final project of the programming for data science course held at UPM semester 2021/2022  

The goal is to design a back testing tool for a fictional investment firm. The first part of the project scrapes the investing.com website and generates a CSV file with historical data on the price movements of a ticker.
